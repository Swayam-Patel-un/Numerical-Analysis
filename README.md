# Numerical Analysis (PH 307)

This repository contains the coursework files for the **Numerical Analysis** course (Course Code: PH 307) at IIT Bombay. This course focuses on numerical methods and their applications in solving mathematical problems that cannot be solved analytically.

## Course Overview

Numerical Analysis is a fundamental area of applied mathematics that deals with the development and analysis of numerical algorithms for solving a variety of mathematical problems. This course covers topics such as:

- Error analysis
- Root-finding methods
- Numerical integration and differentiation
- Interpolation and polynomial approximation
- Numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs)
- Matrix operations and numerical linear algebra

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

- **Lectures**: Notes and materials from course lectures.
- **Assignments**: Completed assignments and their corresponding solutions.
- **Projects**: Any project work conducted as part of the course.
- **Resources**: Additional materials and references for further reading.
